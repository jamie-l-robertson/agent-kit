## Human approve (destructive)

**Any destructive action** requires explicit brief approval: `Human approve: granted`.

When granting, briefs should name the action: `Approved destructive action: <command/env/resource>` (see brief-hygiene). Workers echo that scope in JSON `approvedAction` when they act under the grant. Do not treat a grant as blanket approval for a different destructive step.

Without grant → stop with `needs-decision` and JSON `humanApprove: "required"`. Do not perform the destructive step.

Destructive includes (non-exhaustive): prod/staging apply or deploy; irreversible migrations/deletes; secret rotation that invalidates live credentials; force-push / hard reset / history rewrite; bulk data deletion or live PII remediation; dropping/recreating infra; enabling public exposure of private services.

Non-destructive implement work (additive features, tests, docs) → `Human approve: n/a` unless the brief says otherwise.

Audit-only / verify-only (no destructive side effects) → `humanApprove: "n/a"`.
